Before placing your phone in the Cardboard, make sure to either start a game as a host/server, or join a game as a client!

Then, place your phone in the Cardboard.

The host is the 'strategist'. Lead your friends to the switches by placing beacons corresponding to their color, and once they've pressed them all, lead them to the exit! Choose your beacon's color by pressing the trigger while looking at an option from the palette. Place a beacon by pulling the trigger while looking at the maze. You can have one beacon of each color at a time.

If you are a client, make your way through the maze and press the switches the host leads you to. Look for beacons in the sky to guide you. Then, find the exit. Move my pulling the trigger while facing the direction you would like to go.

Access the UI by looking up, where you can pause and quit the game. Interact with the UI by using the trigger.

Try to solve the maze as quickly as possible!
